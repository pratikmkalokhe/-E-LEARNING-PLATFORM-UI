##This project focuses on designing the front-end interface of an E-Learning platform using modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, or a framework like React.js. The platform offers a multi page, interactive experience that allows users to browse courses, track learning progress, and watch embedded video lessons all within a clean, intuitive UI.
Key features include:
Course Listing Page displaying available courses with images, titles, and brief descriptions
Course Detail Page with embedded videos, downloadable resources, and lesson navigation
Progress Tracking using visual indicators like progress bars or percentage completion for each course
Navigation System enabling smooth transitions between Home, Courses, and Profile or Dashboard pages
Responsive Design ensuring usability across desktops, tablets, and smartphones
The UI is styled for clarity and engagement, using consistent colors, typography, and iconography. Interactive elements such as hover effects, collapsible menus, and video modals enhance user interaction. CSS Grid and Flexbox are used to build fluid layouts, while JavaScript or React handles dynamic updates like progress saving and video playback control.
This front-end project lays the groundwork for full e-learning platforms and can be easily extended with user authentication, quizzes, and backend integration. It provides a strong showcase of UI/UX design skills, component structuring, and real world application flow ideal for portfolios or educational tools.
